2) The tow-columns data indicates the expected return (/mu_i) and standard deviation (/sigma_i) repectively for each asset.
3) The three-columns data denotes the correlation coefficient (/ro_{i,j}) between asset i and j.

In addition, the ef.txt is the obtained Unconstrained Pareto Front of each data.
